# ChatBot
Eliza is a talking bot program that will interact with a user and responds to the user using a pre-defined set of instructions that are defined in the program.
The objective is to	gain	experience	with	the	Python programming	language,	in	particular the	use	of	regular	expressions in	order	to do	"word	spotting"	and	transform	sentences	from	answers	into	questions.	To	gain an appreciation	for	the	difficulties	of	natural	language	processing in general.

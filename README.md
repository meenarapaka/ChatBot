# ChatBot
Eliza is a talking bot program that will interact with a user and responds to the user using a pre-defined set of instructions that are defined in the program.
The objective is to	gain	experience	with	the	Python programming	language,	in	particular the	use	of	regular	expressions #in	order	to do	"word	spotting"	and	transform	sentences	from	answers	into	questions.	To	gain an #appreciation	for	the	difficulties	of	natural	language	processing	in	general.
